//! @brief      Basic RF library header file.
//!
//!             The "Basic RF" library contains simple functions for packet
//!             transmission and reception with the IEEE 802.15.4 compliant
//!             radio devices. The intention of this library is to demonstrate
//!             how the radio devices are operated, and not to provide a
//!             complete and fully-functional packet protocol. The protocol
//!             uses 802.15.4 MAC compliant data and acknowledgment packets,
//!             however it contains only a small subset of  the 802.15.4
//!             standard:
//!             - Association, scanning nor beacons are not implemented
//!             - No defined coordinator/device roles (peer-to-peer, all nodes
//!               are equal)
//!             - Waits for the channel to become ready, but does not check CCA
//!               twice (802.15.4 CSMA-CA)
//!             - Does not retransmit packets
//!
//!             INSTRUCTIONS:
//!             Startup:
//!             1. Create a basicRfCfg_t structure, and initialize the members:
//!             2. Call basicRfInit() to initialize the packet protocol.
//!
//!             Transmission:
//!             1. Create a buffer with the payload to send
//!             2. Call basicRfSendPacket()
//!
//!             Reception:
//!             1. Check if a packet is ready to be received by highger layer
//!                with basicRfPacketIsReady()
//!             2. Call basicRfReceive() to receive the packet by higher layer
//!
//!             FRAME FORMATS:
//!             Data packets (without security):
//!             [Preambles (4)][SFD (1)][Length (1)][Frame control field (2)]
//!             [Sequence number (1)][PAN ID (2)][Dest. address (2)][Source address (2)]
//!             [Payload (Length - 2+1+2+2+2)][Frame check sequence (2)]
//!
//!             Acknowledgment packets:
//!             [Preambles (4)][SFD (1)][Length = 5 (1)][Frame control field (2)]
//!             [Sequence number (1)][Frame check sequence (2)]
